The project mainly aims at implementing the mechanism of modern cars with the help of can bus. It monitors the end devices over the network with the help of sensors that send the data to cloud and the user can send commands for an action to be performed at the actuator end in response to the sensor. Sensors used for collecting data are IR sensor and a Buzzer which sends data through can bus to gateway. At the gateway for which beagle bone is used, these metrics are collected using CAN Bus. The data collected is stored in database and sent to server over cloud by using Edge Computing Principles. The data collected can be used to exploit the various features of the car and used for improvement.
